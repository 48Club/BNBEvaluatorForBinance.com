A userscript to evaluate your asset in BNB in binance user asset page

# Installation
## Chromium series browsers
Install the tampermonkey extension
Then just browse the user.js file, click "raw" to view the source, it will automatically be done.
## Firefox
Not tested, but I suppose it supports userscript even better then chrome.
